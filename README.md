# Activity Chooser

Ever plan to arrive somewhere early and want to see what activities are near your destination? Activity Chooser is a web app created by Rachel Shen which uses Yelp's API to provide pit stops that match your selection. You are provided information about the business you choose, as well as a Google Map with markers of your current location, the activity, and destination. If you prefer an activity near your current location, that is also an option!
